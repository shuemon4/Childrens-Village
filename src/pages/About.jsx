              <p className="mb-4">
                Children's Village Montessori School was founded with a simple mission: to provide high-quality, 
                nurturing care and education for young children in a safe and stimulating environment.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Since our founding, we have been dedicated to the Montessori philosophy, which emphasizes 
                child-centered learning, independence, and respect for each child's natural development.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we continue to grow and evolve, but our core values remain the same: to foster a 
                love of learning, build confidence, and help each child develop to their fullest potential.

            <p className="mb-8 text-lg">
              At Children's Village Montessori School, we believe that every child is unique and deserves 
              an education tailored to their individual needs, interests, and developmental stage.

                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  We follow the Montessori approach, which places the child at the center of the learning 
                  experience. Our classrooms are designed to allow children to explore and discover at their 
                  own pace, with teachers serving as guides rather than instructors.

                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  We focus on the whole childâ€”intellectual, physical, social, and emotional development. 
                  Our curriculum includes activities that promote fine and gross motor skills, language 
                  development, social interaction, and cognitive growth.

                  Our classrooms are carefully designed with child-sized furniture and materials that are 
                  accessible, organized, and inviting. This prepared environment allows children to develop 
                  independence and a sense of order.

                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  We treat each child with respect and dignity, acknowledging their thoughts, feelings, and 
                  ideas. We believe that this respect fosters self-confidence and a positive attitude toward 
                  learning.
